##KissAnime Next Video Autoplayer
User Script for Kissanime and packaged browser extensions.
Plays the next video in the list automatically when the previous video is finished.

Add to a userscript extension such as GreaseMonkey or search in webstore.

This script is designed for userscript first - then ported to its relevant extensions.
To work with, install node and npm, and run npm install.
Then run grunt.
